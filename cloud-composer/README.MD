# Overview  

The blog for this code on 'Building a Stock Data Workflow with Google Cloud Composer, Cloud Storage, and BigQuery' is published on [Medium](https://medium.com/@amarachi.ogu/implementing-ci-cd-in-cloud-composer-using-cloud-build-and-github-part-2-a721e4ed53da)

It looks at how to use Cloud Composer to build a workflow that creates a bucket in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), pulls stock data from yfinance into the bucket, moves the data to BigQuery for analysis, and then deletes the GCS bucket.
